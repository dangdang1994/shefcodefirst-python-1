    Recap: Using Python from the terminal </h3>
  Open a terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows) and open Python
  in interactive mode by typing:
  <code>python -i</code>
  <br>
  Your terminal will look similar to this:

  <h3><i class="fa fa-reply" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Recap: Creating a script</h3>
  Open your text editor and create a new file called
  <strong> session2.py </strong>
  that contains the following:
  <pre><code>print("Hello World!")</code></pre> and save the file.
</section>

<section>
  <h3> <i class="fa fa-reply" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Recap: Running your script</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Open your terminal if needed </li>
    <li> Make sure you are in the file location
      (if you need to make sure type <code>ls</code>)</li>
    <li> Type the following command </li>
    <pre><code>python session2.py</code></pre>
    <li>Your script should reply with <strong>Hello world</strong></li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h3> <i class="fa fa-reply" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Recap: Strings and Variables</h3>
  <div><em><strong>String:</strong> a collection of characters denoted by " "</em></div>
  <div><em><strong>Variable:</strong> a named location that stores some data</em></div>
</section>

<section>
  Let's change our code to print a <strong>variable</strong>
  that stores a <strong>string</strong> representation of your name.
  <div data-markdown>
    ```python
    name = "Your name here"
    print("Hello {}!".format(name))
    ```
    Now run your script from the terminal:
    ```bash
    python session2.py
    ```
  </div>
  <p>Your script should reply with <strong>Hello Your name here</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3> <i class="fa fa-reply" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Recap: Changing variables</h3>
  The contents of a variable can be changed any time after it has been <strong>declared</strong>
  <div data-markdown>
    ```python
    name = "Your name here"
    name = name.upper()
    print("Hello {}!".format(name))
    ```
    Now run your script from the terminal:
    ```bash
    python session2.py
    ```
  </div>
  <p>Your script should reply with <strong>Hello YOUR NAME HERE</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>And now</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>User input</h3>
  <p>A program is made much more useful by allowing a user to interact with it</p>
  <p>We can use the <strong>input</strong> method to get a user's name.</p>
</section>

<section id="user-input">
  Open your <strong>session2.py</strong> file and replace the contents with the following
  <div data-markdown>
    ```python
    print("What's your name?")
    name = input()
    print("Hello {}!".format(name))
    ```
    Now run your script from the terminal:
    ```bash
    python session2.py
    ```

<section>
  <h3>Functions</h3>
  <p>Programming the same task can get boring</p>
  <p>A <strong>function</strong> allows us to reuse code by giving a
    name to a block of code</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Example of functions 1</h3>
  <p> We could use a function to calculate the mean of different number pairs. </p>
  <div data-markdown>   
    # function body
    def calculate_mean(number1, number2):
      answer = (number1 + number2) / 2
      print("The mean of {} and {} is {}.".format(number1, number2, answer))

    # run function for different number pairs 
    calculate_mean(5, 10)
    calculate_mean(1, 11)
    calculate_mean(1, 12)
  </div>
  Running the file in our terminal will give us the following output:
  The mean of 5 and 10 is 7.5.
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Example of functions 2</h3>
  <p> Creating a sentence from given words</p>
  <div data-markdown>   
    # function body 
    def welcome_user(name, location):
      print("Hi {} from {}!".format(name, location))

    # run function for different names and locations
    welcome_user("Sophie", "Manchester")
    welcome_user("Darren", "Sheffield")
    welcome_user("Catherine", "London")
    </div>
    Running the file would display 'Hi Sophie from Manchester!'
</section>

<section>
  Create a new file called <strong>my_first_function.py</strong> and enter the following
  <div data-markdown>
    ```
    def hello_world():
      print("Hello World!")

    hello_world()
    hello_world()
    hello_world()
    ```
    Now run your script from the terminal:
    ```bash
    python my_first_function.py
    ```
  </div>
  <p>It should print out <strong>Hello World!</strong> 3 times</p>
</section>

<section>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>def</strong> tells python we are <strong>defining</strong> a function</li>
    <li><strong>hello_world</strong> is the unique name of our function*</li>
    <li><strong>()</strong> the brackets tell python this function has zero <strong>arguments</strong></li>
    <li><strong>:</strong> the colon tells python the indented lines below this line are a <strong>code block</strong></li>
    <li><strong>hello_world()</strong> is how we <strong>call</strong> our function</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <em>
      *be careful not to overwrite default python functions like
      <strong>print</strong> or <strong>sum</strong>
    </em>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Arguments</h3>
  <p><strong>Arguments</strong> are values passed into a function<p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sometimes we have a block of code we want to customise when we call it</li>
        <li>Arguments go in the brackets <strong>()</strong> when calling a function</li>
        <li>e.g. <strong>print("hello")</strong> prints the value of its argument, which happens to be the string
          <strong>"hello"</strong></li>
      </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Let's start some arguments!</h3>
  <p>Let's see how we can use arguments ourselves<p>
</section>

<section>
  <br>
  Create a new file called <strong>more_arguments.py</strong> and enter the following
  <div data-markdown>
    ```python
    def add_two_numbers():
      number1 = 1
      number2 = 2
      answer = number1 + number2
      print("{} plus {} is {}".format(number1, number2, answer))

    add_two_numbers()
    ```
  </div>
  <p>This is a function with zero arguments (the brackets are empty in the definition)</p>
</section>

<section id="function-args">
  <br>
  Edit <strong>more_arguments.py</strong> and replace the old function with the following
  <div data-markdown>
    ```python
    def add_two_numbers_from_args(number1, number2):
      answer = number1 + number2
      print("{} plus {} is {}".format(number1, number2, answer))

    add_two_numbers_from_args(5, 10)
    add_two_numbers_from_args(1, 11)
    add_two_numbers_from_args(1, 12)
    ```
  </div>
  <p>This is a function with two arguments</p>
  <p>Arguments are named variables only available in the function</p>

<section>
  <h3>Returning stuff from functions</h3>
  <p>Functions do stuff like crunch numbers or manipulate data, and can then <strong>return</strong> the information
    they calculate</p>
</section>

<section>
  <br>
  Create a new file called <strong>returning.py</strong> and enter the following
  <div data-markdown>
    ```python
    def add_two_numbers_and_return_value():
      number1 = 1
      number2 = 2
      answer = number1 + number2
      return answer

    returned_value = add_two_numbers_and_return_value()
    print(returned_value)
    ```
  </div>
  <p><strong>Extra challenge</strong>: change the function to return the result of adding two arguments together</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Lists</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <br>
  Lists are used to store a list of items
  <div data-markdown>
    ```python
    empty_list = []
    numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    fruits = ["pineapples", "oranges", "bananas"]
    mixed = [15, "sunshine", "jumper", 4, "sky"]
    ```
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  Lists are:
  <ul>
    <li>List items go between square brackets</li>
    <li>Items in a list are separated by commas</li>
    <li>Strings in a list must be in quotation marks</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <br>
  You can access an item in a list by using its name and its index number, like this:
  <div data-markdown>
    ```python
    print(fruits[0])
    ```
  </div>
  In the world of programming, the first item in a list is always at position 0 (its "index" position). This means
  that [0] is the first item in the list, [1] is the second item, and so on.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>For loops</h2>
</section>

<section id="for-loops">
  <br>
  For loops can be used to perform actions on each element in a list
  <div data-markdown>
    ```python
    my_shopping_cart = ["cake", "plates", "plastic forks", "juice", "cups"]

    for item in my_shopping_cart:
      print(item)

    for x in my_shopping_cart:
      print("hello!")
      print(x)
    ```

  Create a new file called <strong>logic.py</strong> and enter the following
  <div data-markdown>
    ```python
    number = input("Enter a number between 1 and 10: ")
    
    print(number)

    number = int(number)

    if number > 10:
      print("Too high!")

    if number <= 0: 
      print("Too low!")

  <h2>User input: bonus exercises</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Extend the script by adapting the code from Exercise 11 of the LPTHW e-book.</li>
    <li>
      Simplify the script by not using <code>print(...)</code> to show the questions
      before each input.
    </li>
    <li>
      * Assuming the user will only type in numbers (e.g. 6'2" will be entered as 62),
      print out the sum of the person's age, weight and height. E.g. If the person is 21, weigh
      150 lbs and is 6'2" tall, then the sum is <strong>21 + 150 + 62 = 233</strong>.
