# Judging Criteria

**Your final project/app should be deployed on Heroku, and needs to have:**
- A minimum of two main HTML (template) files (excluding the header and footer)
- A minimum of one CSS file
- A minimum of one Python file
- Some ways in which the user may interact with the app with some input. This can be done by including a HTML form with one or more input fields and a submit button so they can send whatever
they entered in the input fields back to our server, where you can then do something with it (call an
API, influence some logic in a game etc)
- Well formatted code - i.e. usage of meaningful variable names & code structured with sufficient space
such that it's easy to read
- Well commented code - i.e. usage of comments where appropriate to explain complex parts of code


**Whilst it's not necessary, it would be nice to see the following things in your app too:**
- Usage of at least one API to do something with the user's input, OR the user's input is used to influence some control
flow/decision making process of the app (for example, in an interactive questionnaire, or in a game)
- Code logically split into more than one Python file. A good example would be that code that
calls an API should be split into its own file, which can then be re-used in the main Flask
app by importing it back in
- Usage of JavaScript/JQuery to make certain pages of your app more interactive
- A visually appealing design
