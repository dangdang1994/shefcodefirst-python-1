                      You're most likely still running Python in <strong>interactive mode</strong>,
                      which is <strong>a program on its own</strong> and as you can only run one

                      On Mac/Linux computers, Python is pre-installed into the operating system.
                      As such, its version of Python (2.7) is found before the Python version you've
                      downloaded.

                    <p>

                      <code>python3.6 hello.py</code> instead of <code>python hello.py</code>.

                    Try closing git bash first, open it again then run Python. If that

                    <strong>Powershell</strong>, open that and run Python in it instead.
                    If none of that works, speak to an instructor to make sure the python
                    executable is properly registered to be used directly in the command line.

                    They are both softwares for interacting with git, the version control system you
                    will be using throughout this course to backup and work on code together.</p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Git bash</strong> allows you to interact with git through the
                      command prompt/Powershell, whereas <strong>GitKraken</strong>
                      allows you to do the same thing through a pretty and more friendly
                      graphical user interface.

                  <td>
                    You don't need both software together, as GitKraken
                    doesn't depend on git bash. <strong>We recommend you to use
                    GitKraken</strong>, as that will be the software we use to cover how to do
                    anything in class.

                    Why do I get a permission denied error when I try to install a new library
                    (<code>flask</code>, <code>requests</code>, <code>tweepy</code>)
                    required by the course using <strong>pip</strong>?
                  </td>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Mac/Linux</strong>: This happens since Python is pre-installed
                      into the operating system as mentioned before, which means any library code
                      <strong>pip</strong> tries to install may end up in folders that require a
                      higher permission level than the <strong>pip</strong> command has.
                      It's a security mechanism to prevent rogue files being installed onto critical
                      parts of your computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To overcome the issue, if you haven't already, I recommend you install Python 3.6
                      using the Mac OS X installer <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you're using a Linux-based OS... then try installing Python 3.6 by setting up
                      <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv" target="_blank">pyenv</a> instead.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Windows</strong>: Search for the <strong>Powershell</strong> or
                      <strong>cmd</strong> in your start menu. Then, right click the result to start the
                      shell as an <strong>administrator</strong> and try running the commands again. This
                      is relatively safe since we are installing trusted libraries and Windows does not
                      depend on Python like Mac/Linux computers do.

                    them to back to your browser.

                      Firstly, check that you have saved them inside the <strong>static</strong> folder,
                      otherwise Flask won't be able to find and load them onto your page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The next thing to pay attention to is the <strong>spacing</strong> between the
                      <code>{{ }}</code> used to output the location of the assets. There should be
                      <strong>no spaces</strong> between the double curly braces/brackets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If that's not the problem, then check that you're using <strong>single quotes</strong>
                      in the arguments of the <code>url_for</code> function call. This is important
                      since using double quotes in the <code>url_for</code> function call arguments
                      would close off the double quote we used for the <code>src</code> or
                      <code>href</code> attribute in our HTML for including our assets.

                    You most likely have defined functions <strong>with the same name</strong> twice
                    or more! Since function names in the same Python file have to be unique, the error

                      You have probably tried to "visit" the app by double clicking the HTML file
                      directly in File Explorer/Finder. This is <strong>not</strong> the right way to
                      visit your app since your browser won't understand the additional template syntax
                      that's not really part of HTML!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The correct way to visit your app is by typing <code>localhost:5000/...</code>,
                      as this ensures your template HTML will be run through the template engine which
                      <strong>does</strong> know how to interpret the additional syntax and so will
                      process and remove them before they are returned to the browser! 
                    </p>
